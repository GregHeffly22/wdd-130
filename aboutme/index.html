        <h2>Greg Evans</h2>
        <h3>Don't call my Gregory.</h3>

        <p style> My name is Greg Evans, and I am from North Reading, 
        Massachusetts. If you don't know where that is, it is just the suburbs of Boston.</p>
        <p class="purple"> I am a Freshman, and a computer science major currently. That could change.</p>
        <p id="fine-print">My favorite things to do curretly is to play video games, hang out with people, and build
        legos. However, the thing I spend the most time on is school.</p>
        <p>I have three cats back home. They are named Keeper, Jack, and Bagel. Ironically, I am allergic
        to one of the cats, so when I am home I have to constantly take allergy meds or my life is constantly 
        painful. I love them regardless of my allergen status.</p>
