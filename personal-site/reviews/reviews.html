                    Sometimes simple is best. This is best exemplified by this shoe. The comfort is that of a typlical
                    Van. Wear it too much, and your heel hurts. This is a great low key shoe, and I would wear it on
                    a regular basis. The color on this Shoe also helps it out. A nice blue is colorful, but doesn't
                    take away from an outfit.

                    I am going to be honest, these shoes are not the most comfortable. Due to the sizing of vans, these
                    end up being too slender. This pinches the sides of the feet, causing high levels of discomfort. On 
                    top of that, they are not pretty. They would be great if you are just fooling around, and want some funny 
                    shoes. Otherwise, not worth the money.

                    Simple is still very good here. I think that this shoe would be a good one to wear as well. The 
                    comfort is exactly the same as the Royal Blue Old Skool. I think the color of this van is amazing. 
                    Vans has been doing some good things lately with their checkerboard patterns, and I am liking it a 
                    lot. The red and cream add a lot to an outfit, without being the main focus.

                    This shoe is certainly interesting. I would not say that this is the best shoe. This shoe is 
                    comfortable enough. Vans are just not built for comfort at the end of the day. The problem I 
                    have with this shoe is that it just clashes. it sticks out too much. At least with the spongebob 
                    shoes you are able to say you are wearing it because it is fun. These have no excuse.
